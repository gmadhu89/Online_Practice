    "Objective\n",
    "Today, we're taking what we learned yesterday about Inheritance and extending it to Abstract Classes. Because this is a very specific Object-Oriented concept, submissions are limited to the few languages that use this construct. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!\n",
    "\n",
    "Task\n",
    "Given a Book class and a Solution class, write a MyBook class that does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Inherits from Book\n",
    "Has a parameterized constructor taking these 3 parameters:\n",
    "string title\n",
    "string author\n",
    "int price\n",
    "Implements the Book class' abstract display() method so it prints these 3 lines:\n",
    "1. Title:, a space, and then the current instance's title.\n",
    "2. Author: a space,and then the current instance's author.\n",
    "3. Price: a space, and then the current instance's  price.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Note: Because these classes are being written in the same file, you must not use an access modifier (e.g.: public) when declaring MyBook or your code will not execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input Format\n",
    "You are not responsible for reading any input from stdin. The Solution class creates a Book object and calls the MyBook class constructor (passing it the necessary arguments). It then calls the display method on the Book object.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Output Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The void display () method should print and label the respective title,author , and price of the MyBook object's instance (with each value on its own line) like so:    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Title: $title\n",
    "Author: $author\n",
    "Price: $price\n",
    "    \n",
    "Note: The $ is prepended to variable names to indicate they are placeholders for variables.\n",

    "The following input from stdin is handled by the locked stub code in your editor:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Alchemist\n",
    "Paulo Coelho\n",
